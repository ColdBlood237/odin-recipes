        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) is made with chicken and full of pickled vegetables. My husband works
            around a lot of Vietnamese restaurants, and I was making him bring me home these tasty sandwiches. Finally I
            attempted to make one, and here it is. I also love the pickled vegetables, so I make sure there are plenty
            of those.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup rice vinegar</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>¼ cup matchstick-cut carrots</li>
            <li>¼ cup peeled and matchstick-cut daikon radish</li>
            <li>¼ cup thinly sliced white onion</li>
            <li>1 skinless, boneless chicken breast half</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine rice vinegar, sugar, and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until
                sugar has dissolved, about 1 minute. Allow the mixture to cool..
            </li>
            <li>
                Place carrot, radish, and onion in a bowl. Pour in cooled vinegar mixture and let marinate at least 30
                minutes. </li>
            <li>
                While vegetables marinate, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the broiler.
                Lightly oil a slotted broiler pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle chicken breast with garlic salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place chicken on the prepared pan and broil, turning once, until browned and no longer pink in the
                center, about 6 minutes per side.
            </li>
        </ol>
